Welcome to 101 Beginning Python!
==================================================

This series is to give you an idea what programming is and learn the basics, the most fundamental ideas / concepts of programming. 

You'll learn enough to solve small problems so you can apply what you learnt.

What You Will Learn
-------------------

.. topic:: Idea #1 - Data Types

    How do humans interact with machines if it only understands 1s and 0s? Data types allow us to represent numbers, strings, etc in human readable manner. Learn some of the basic built-in data types in Python.

.. topic:: Idea #2 - Variables, Statements and Expressions

    A program needs a mechanism to "remember" instructions. Here is where you'll learn how to do it and the different types of instructions - statements vs expressions.

.. topic:: Idea #3 - Control Flow

    A program executes instructions from a top-down approach, but what if you wanted to take control of how it flows? Conditional statement is one approach. Learn about using various operators to form conditions.

.. topic:: Idea #4 - Function

    Functions are a core idea of breaking down problems into bite-sized pieces. Get an idea of how a program works with functions - input, process, output.

.. topic:: Idea #5 - String Manipulations

    Strings in are very powerful in Python - all the symbols you can think of, even Chinese or Arabic characters, and even emojis can be represented as Strings in Python. Explore the built-in methods and other tricks to manipulate Strings in Python.
