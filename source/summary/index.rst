**Congratulations**, you have leveled up! By now, we hope you have experienced solving problems with Python. 

You might realize how easy it is for humans to do so but it is extremely difficult to break down solutions into step-by-step instructions for machines to understand.

As you practice to solve more problems, you'll get better at it. Don't give up!
